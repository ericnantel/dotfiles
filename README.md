### Hello. Bonjour

My name is Eric Nantel. I am a SENIOR Rendering Architect.

Do you wish to make your life simpler as a developer?

If the answer is yes, please keep reading. :)

I created this repository for anyone who wants to install my vim/neovim setup on their computer, while I am still learning Vim and NeoVim. I might try Emacs one day, but not today. I welcome anyone to suggest me plugins or configs on social medias. 

Please consider following me on GitHub, X (formerly Twitter), Threads (from Meta).

Be sure to read the 'Getting started' first, which is going to tell you everything I would install prior to Vim or NeoVim on any machine, as a developer.
