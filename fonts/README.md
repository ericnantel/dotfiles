I (the maintainer of this project) have taken the liberty to copy fonts 
directly from these repositories legally and with good faith:
- https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts

I made sure to add licenses next to those fonts.

Main reason for not adding these repositories (mentionned above) as submodules
is that they might be too big to clone.
