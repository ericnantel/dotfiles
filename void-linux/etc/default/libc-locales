#
# List of GNU libc locales regenerated by the glibc-locales package.
# All libc locales are available in /usr/share/i18n/locales.
#
# If you add new locales you can regenerate them with:
#		"xbps-reconfigure -f glibc-locales"
#
## This file names the currently supported and somewhat tested locales.
## If you have any additions please file a glibc bug report.
#
# NOTE: This is a simplified version of the original generated file.
